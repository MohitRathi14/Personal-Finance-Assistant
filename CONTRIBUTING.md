# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Personal Finance Assistant! A few guidelines:

- Keep secrets out of the repo: never commit `.env` files or secret keys.
- Open a new branch for your work, follow the branch naming convention: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`.
- Write clear commit messages and open a pull request describing the change.
- Run linters and tests (if any) before opening a PR.

If you're unsure, open an issue first to discuss larger changes.
